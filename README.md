BHealth is a web and mobile application designed to streamline laboratory services management in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The application caters to two types of customers: users seeking laboratory services and private laboratories providing those services. BHealth offers a user-friendly platform for searching, comparing, and scheduling appointments for laboratory services, while also providing a secure space for users to store and access their test results. For laboratories, BHealth offers a unique solution to manage their entire workflow, including storing previous and future appointments. 



## Key Features 



Efficient Search and Comparison: Users can easily search and compare laboratory services based on various parameters such as location, price, and service availability. This feature enables users to make informed decisions and choose the most suitable laboratory for their needs. 



Appointment Scheduling: BHealth provides a seamless appointment scheduling system, allowing users to book appointments for laboratory services directly through the application. This feature saves time and eliminates the hassle of making appointments over the phone or in person. 



Secure Test Result Storage: Users can securely store and access their test results within the application. BHealth ensures data privacy and confidentiality, providing a convenient and centralized location for users to keep track of their medical records. 



Streamlined Workflow for Laboratories: Private laboratories benefit from BHealth's comprehensive solution, which centralizes their entire working flow. The application allows laboratories to manage their appointments, store previous records, and plan for future appointments efficiently.
